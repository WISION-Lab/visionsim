# VisionSIM: Towards a Sensor-Realistic World Simulator

A modular and extensible framework that realistically emulates many different sensor types, alongside rich pixel-perfect ground truth annotations across low-, mid-, and high-level scene characteristics, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic camera properties.

*Warning:* This project is under heavy development and still considered unstable.
